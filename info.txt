Inspiration

Some ideas worth exploring:

• What is the average length of the trip?

• Average number of rides per week or per month?

• Total tax savings based on traveled business miles?

• Percentage of business miles vs personal vs. Meals

• How much money can be saved by a typical customer using Uber, Careem, or Lyft versus regular cab service?
