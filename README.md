# Analyzing & Visualzing Uber Rides

In this repository you will find some interesting visualization and statistics from a dataset I found on Kaggel. This dataset was uploaded by Zeeshan-ul-hassan Usmani that shows his Uber rides in 2016. 

You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/zusmani/uberdrives) and my analyses in [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mallaham/d/zusmani/uberdrives/network-analysis-of-uber-rides)

Enjoy your time :-)
